        For us CakeHut means 'Food of the Gods', befitting our exclusive and
        indulgent range of offerings that include brownies, cakes, desserts,
        chocolates, breads, and savouries.

        From our humble beginnings in 2004, when the first CakeHut pastry store
        opened its doors at the iconic Cusrow Baug at Colaba Causeway (Mumbai),
        we've grown to become a Pan-India chain of patisseries with stores in
        over 30 cities.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-[30px] bg-white">
        Our mission is to spread happiness by serving smiles on a plate, and
        this journey continues as we open CakeHut patisseries across the
        country.
